## ✨ Key Features

### Discovery Algorithm
- **Minimum Rating**: Default 7.0+ (adjustable)
- **Maximum Popularity**: Default ≤20.0 (adjustable)
- **Minimum Votes**: 50+ (ensures credible ratings)

### Gem Score Formula
```python
gem_score = (rating / 10.0) * (100.0 / (popularity + 10))
```

**Higher score = Better gem**
- Balances high rating with low popularity
- Movies with rating 8.0 and popularity 5 score higher than 7.5/2

### Filters
- **Genre**: Filter by specific genre
- **Decade**: Filter by decade (1920s-2020s)
- **Minimum Rating**: Adjustable threshold (default 7.0)
- **Maximum Popularity**: How "hidden" (default 20.0)

### Sorting Options
1. **Gem Score** (default): Best balance of rating & obscurity
2. **Highest Rating**: Sort by rating only
3. **Most Hidden**: Lowest popularity first
4. **Newest First**: Recent hidden gems

## 🔧 Customization

### Change Default Thresholds

In `app.py`, line ~211:
```python
min_rating = request.args.get("min_rating", default=7.0, type=float)  # Change 7.0
max_popularity = request.args.get("max_popularity", default=20.0, type=float)  # Change 20.0
```

### Adjust Minimum Vote Count

In `app.py`, line ~218:
```python
Movie.vote_count >= 50  # Change to 30 (more movies) or 100 (higher quality)
```

### Modify Gem Score Algorithm

In `app.py`, line ~242:
```python
# Current formula
movie.gem_score = (movie.vote_average / 10.0) * (100.0 / (movie.popularity + 10))

# Alternative: Emphasize obscurity more
movie.gem_score = (movie.vote_average / 10.0) * (200.0 / (movie.popularity + 5))

# Alternative: Emphasize rating more
movie.gem_score = (movie.vote_average ** 2) / (movie.popularity + 10)
```

---

## 📊 SQL Query Details

### The Main Query
```python
query = session.query(Movie).filter(
    Movie.vote_average >= min_rating,      # High rating
    Movie.popularity <= max_popularity,     # Low popularity
    Movie.vote_count >= 50                  # Credible votes
)
```

### Sorting by Gem Score
```python
query.order_by(
    desc(Movie.vote_average / (func.log(Movie.popularity + 2) * 2))
)
```

Uses logarithmic scaling to balance rating vs. popularity.
